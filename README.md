# PD2-TacticalLeaning
 Tactical Leaning mod for PAYDAY 2
 Adds the ability to "lean", similar to games like Rainbow Six: Siege.
 This does not have additional effects.

Requires the mod "HoldTheKey" in order to work!
	Download link and instructions for HoldTheKey can be found here:

	Or, an alternate link to its GitHub repository, if ModWorkshop is down:

To use this mod, bind a key in the Mod Keybinds menu or the Tactical Leaning mod options menu, and use those keys in-game to lean left or right.

Now compatible with controllers- you can enable "Controller Mode" in the Mod Options menu.
	To use with controllers:
		While ADS (aiming down sights), press the SPRINT or MELEE button to lean left or right.
	You can also choose to automatically exit leaning after leaving ADS, by toggling the "Controller: Automatic Un-Lean" option in the Mod Options menu.
	(This, of course, only applies when Controller Mode is on.)
You can also adjust the angle and distance of your lean in the Mod Options menu.
